Deep within the abandoned oil mines rests the Wind Element Keeper. Hibernating just below the oil lake, the Mecha Mite Boss is rudely awakened by our trespassing hedgehog and begins to lift itself from the black muck. This huge creature upsets the balance of rock and oil pockets and starts a chain reaction- As shards of sharp clay and rock fall into the shaking lake below. Oil oozes steadily out of reopened wounds in the cavern's walls. The whole earth shakes as Sonic's new challenge becomes apparent. Sonic is protected (for the moment) within a 6-tiered, cylindrical glass tower. On each floor, facing either North, South, East or West   is a metal pipe that Sonic must spindash into to reach the floor above. Time is limited as the oil steadily rises on the outside and within this structure. An enemy or two will harass Sonic before the entrance to each pipe. Meanwhile, shaking and clawing its way to the top of the tower is the Mecha Mite, dripping with oil. Once Sonic reaches the top, the pipe he used crashes down into the now-paused muck. The Mecha Mite Boss attacks first by rising up and opening its immense three jaws to blow "oil wads" at Sonic. The Boss can also suck in huge pockets of air- Sonic must stand behind something or be pulled into the nasty, teeth-ridden jaws of Mecha Mite. Occasionally (and constantly before its death) the Boss spits out an appropriate enemy to attack Sonic. The final stage for this Boss is when it rises above the tower and holds onto the top with its claw appendages. Sonic must destroy these to send the Boss falling to its death.<br>
